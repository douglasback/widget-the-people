They forced her to pull her car over and violently assaulted her. The biracial passenger of the car, Brandon Pettiford, was the real target of the assault. Racial slurs were hurled at Brandon while he was nearly kicked to death. According to the attackers' own words they pursued him because he had flirted and danced with a white girl at a house party earlier that evening. The three accused attackers are being held on a small bond and one minor felony despite Brandon's critical condition. Local authorities claim their hands are tied, largely because of the lack of state legislation against hate crimes. Please direct the Department of Justice to investigate the matter.

Live trapping, especially with footholds, typically causes no harm or suffering, and has allowed many species to be successfully reintroduced to native habitats where they were previously driven out. Trapping is carefully regulated by state game agencies, preventing over-harvest or physical damage to the animals. Without medicine, animals are prone to death by disease, as well as starvation or predation, especially as populations grow; those which do survive often move into human habitats and cause damage. Trapping prevents and corrects these situations by keeping populations if check.

Mandate Requiring Catholic Employers to Provide Contraceptives/Abortifacients to Their Employees","body":"The present Administration, through the Health and Human Services Department, is mandating that all employer healthcare insurance plans provide coverage for procedures which violate the beliefs of the Catholic Church, and Catholic institutions.\r\n\r\nBasically, the new rules require the Catholic Church, and the institutions operating faithfully under the aegis of the Church, to provide coverage for contraceptive drugs and procedures. This requirement violates the beliefs of the Church. \r\n\r\nNever before has the United States Government deigned to represent \"transcendental truth\" on matters of conscience for any religion within these United States.
